Hey guys, wanted to share the code I've been working on so far!
There are 2 repos:

- https://github.com/jugheadjones10/pushworld
  - This one contains the code implementing the Pushworld environment. I forked the original code from the paper and made some small changes to make it easier to solve.
- https://github.com/jugheadjones10/rl-for-dummies
  - This repo contains the main code needed to train our Meta-RL model. There are a bunch of files implementing different algorithms, but you can ignore most of those. The file that implements our Meta-RL algorithm is at `rl_for_dummies/pushworld/meta_a2c_pushworld.py`.
  - Setup instructions:
    1. Install Poetry on your system: https://python-poetry.org/docs/
    2. Install Taskfile on your system: https://taskfile.dev/installation/
    3. At the root of the repo, run `poetry install`
    4. Then run `poetry shell` to activate the virtual env
    5. At the root of the repo, there is a file called "Taskfile" that contains aliases to different training commands. To run the one that trains our Meta-RL algorithm on Pushworld, run `task train_meta_a2c_pushworld`
