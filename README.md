# RL for Dummies

RL code and experiments for simple RL algorithms like REINFORCE, in the style of [CleanRL](https://docs.cleanrl.dev/) and [MinimalRL](https://github.com/seungeunrho/minimalRL).

We put a focus on Jax.

### Supported behavior for CleanRL-based environments

- Dynamically load environment and network to use with it
- ...Work on dqn_simple_jax.py first, and then do a sweep of other algorithms and ensure they are all the same.
